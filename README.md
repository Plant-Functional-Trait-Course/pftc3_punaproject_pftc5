# Data Clenaing for PFTC3, Puna project & PFTC5

## Repo Structure

All relevant scripts for importing, cleaning and exporting can be found in
`/code`. For simplicity the cleaning script for the traits data have been
split out by project. `species_traits_export.R` calls the three scripts
for the three projects and then exports them *i.e.* you only need to
open and run that file. All species cover datasets are contained in
`species_cover.R`
